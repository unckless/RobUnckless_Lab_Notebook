# 10 DNA only extractions from the first set of _Porites_ and _Pocillopora_ Corals from Mo'orea, 7 to try again, and 3 of Kevin's Astrangia samples

#### Using the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus [kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

_Mo'orea new samples_
- [Beads](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/disruption-beads-0-5mm-yeast-1/50212143?searchHijack=true&searchTerm=50212143&searchType=RAPID&matchedCatNo=50212143) were poured into the new sample tubes. The new beads should be easier to pipette the liquid out of them as the do not get sucked up by the p20
- Samples were homogenized by vortexing for ~60 seconds for all samples
- Most of the liquid from the tubes was removed by pipetting. This was about 400µl. The tubes contained a small amount of liquid and un-homogenized tissue left, so 200µl of DNA/RNA shield was added to each tube and those were put back into the -20
- Following recommendations for samples in DNA/RNA Shield from the kit protocol, 200µl of Solid Tissue Buffer and 12µl of Proteinase K were added to each sample  
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm  

_Mo'orea try again samples_
- Whatever tissue was left was in ~300µl and the beads in the -20, another 100µl of DNA/RNA shield was added to make it roughly the same volume as the above samples
- Tubes were vortexed again for ~30 seconds to homogenize more
- 200µl of Blue Solid Tissue buffer and 12µl of Proteinase K were added to each sample (beads and all)
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm
- After digestion, as much liquid was removed as possible, all tubes still had some tissue in them. _Sample 39 was very mucusy still_
- Volume was about 500µl

_Astrangia samples_
- Samples were already lysed and stored as 500µl in the -80
- After the Mo'orea samples had digested for 5 hours, these samples were taken out to thaw
- 500µl of G-DNA binding buffer was added to each tube, vortexed, and spun down
- Extraction then followed the same way as the Mo'orea samples

**Following DNA extraction went along exactly as [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/18-Moorea-Coral-Extractions/)**



**Qubit**

- Broad Range dsDNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice

**Gel Verification**

- A 1.5% agarose gel was ran to check the integrity of the genomic DNA
- Following the PPP Lab [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
