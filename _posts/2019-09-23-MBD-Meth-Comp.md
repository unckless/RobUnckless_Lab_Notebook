## Methyl-Binding Domain Enrichment of Samples for Methylation Comparison

### Shearing Samples to ~500bp

1. Prepare samples for 1µg in 80µl of Tris HCl

|Sample|Volume DNA|Volume Tris HCl|
|---|---|---|
|1041|16.03|63.97|
|1471|18.25|61.75|
|1637|18.25|68.48|
|1101|36.9|43.1|
|1548|43.29|36.71|
|1628|58.82|21.18|

2. Prep Qsonica following [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qsonica/)
3. Set time for 1min 30 sec, 15 second on 15 seconds off, 25% amplitude
4. Check samples on tapestation after results [1]() [2]()
5. Samples 1637 and 1628 were in the more 600bp range average so were sonicated for 15 seconds more

### MBD Enrichment

_Made 43000µl of 1X Wash/Bind buffer from 5X concentrate before starting_

11. Added 93µl of 1X bind/wash buffer to each tube to get up to a total of 100µl
12. Transferred diluted protein to the washed bead tubes for a total volume of 200µl in each of 2 tubes
13. Put samples on the rotisserie mixer for 1 hour at room temp

14. Spun down **briefly** tubes from above
15. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
16. Removed supernatant when clear
17. Resuspended beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipetted to mix
18. Mixed beads on rotisserie mixer for 5 minutes at room temp
19. Repeated: Spun down tubes **briefly**
20. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
21. Removed supernatant when clear
22. Resuspended beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipetted to mix
23. Mixed beads on rotisserie mixer for 5 minutes at room temp
24. Repeated again: Spun down tubes **briefly**
25. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
26. Removed supernatant when clear
27. Resuspended beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipetted to mix
28. Mixed beads on rotisserie mixer for 5 minutes at room temp
29. Finally: Spun down tubes **briefly**
30. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
31. Removed supernatant when clear
32. Resuspended beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipetted to mix

**Capture Reaction**

33. To 6 new 1.5mL tubes, added 20µl each of **5X** bind/wash buffer
34. To each appropriate tube, added the 80µl of the sheared DNA samples (above)
35. Transferred all of each diluted DNA sample to separate tubes with the MBD-Biotin bound beads for a total of 200µl in each tube and pipetted to mix
36. Mixed on rotisserie mixer overnight at 4 degrees C in the cold room

**September 24th 2019, Removing Non-Captured DNA**

38. Again started by writing out protocol to calculate how much 1X bind/wash buffer to dilute (25000µl needed and appropriately diluted)
39. Took tubes out of the cold room rotisserie and spun down **briefly**
40. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
41. Removed clear supernatant and **SAVED** in tubes labeled non-captured DNA and sample number
42. Resuspended beads in 200µl of 1X bind/wash buffer and placed on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
43. Spun down tubes **briefly**
44. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
45. Removed clear supernatant and **SAVED** in tubes labeled wash and the sample number
46. Repeated: added 200µl 1X bind/wash buffer and placed on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
47. Spun down tubes **briefly**

**Ethanol Precipitation**

Each tube for ethanol precipitation gets 1µl of glycogen (co-precipitator), 1/10th the volume of the sample of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of the sample 100% ethanol:

_note, 3M sodium acetate is kept in the acid cabinet and volumes were added to samples in the hood_

|Sample|vol glycogen (µl)|vol sodium acetate (µl)| vol 100% EtOH (µl)|

58. Vortexed to mix and spun down
59. Placed tubes in the -80 freezer for 3.5 hours
60. Set centrifuge to 1 degrees C  with about 15 min time left and let it run to get down to temp
61. Put 70% EtOH in -20 to chill down
62. Took sample tubes out of -80 and centrifuged for **15 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
63. Took tubes out of centrifuge **one at a time** to keep cold, looked at tubes to see if there was a pellet. The non-captured 1431 sample did not have a visible pellet. In all these steps tubes were taken out of the centrifuge one at a time to keep them cold
64. Removed the supernatant and discarded **very carefully**. All samples had a very very small visible pellet
65. Added 500µl of **cold** 70% EtOH to each tube carefully
66. Centrifuged for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
67. **Very carefully** removed supernatant from pellet
68. Centrifuged tubes for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C at 14,000 rcf
69. Removed any remaining supernatant as best as possible with the smallest pipette tip and making sure to not removed the pellet
70. Air dried pellet for 3 minutes
71. Resuspended pellets in 25µl of ultra pure water
