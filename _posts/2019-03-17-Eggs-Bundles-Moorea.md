title: Montipora Eggs and Bundles Troubleshooting and Mo'orea Test DNA/RNA Extraction
tags: [ DNA/RNA Extraction, Montipora, DNA, RNA ]
---

#### Previous DNA/RNA test extractions with the _Montipora_ eggs and bundles from the biomineralization project showed some problems with reliably getting both DNA and RNA from the samples

#### Additionally, _Porites_ and _Pocillopora_ tissue stored in DNA/RNA Shield at -20 from the Putnam-Puritz Mo'orea project needed to have extractions tested on it

#### Using the Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction [Kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

**Mo'orea Samples**  
Trying two species: Massive _Porites_ and _Pocillopora verrucosa_. Samples are stored in the -20 in DNA/RNA Shield. For some reason 1 sample of each species is liquid at -20 and one sample of each species is frozen. To test, I tried taking just the liquid from the liquid samples and bead homogenizing with the frozen samples.

|Sample #|Date Collected|Type|Extraction method|
|-----|-------|------|---|
|1|2018/03/11|Massive Porites|take liquid ~250µl|
|2|2018/03/11|Massive Porites|bead homogenize|
|11|2018/03/11|Pocillopora verrucosa|take liquid ~250µl|
|12|2018/03/11|Pocillopora verrucosa|bead homogenize|

**Sample Prep**

Eggs and Bundles:  
- Samples were taken 1 at a time out of the -80 to minimize thawing
- 600µl of DNA/RNA Shield was added to each tube
- Half of the volume was transferred to second tubes for samples 112 and 123  
_It was very hard to pipette up the eggs/bundles even with the p1000. They had probably begun to lyse, sometimes the pipette got clogged or it was mucus-y_
- For samples 111 and 120 60µl of PK Digestion buffer and 30µl of Proteinase K were added
- For samples 112 A, 112 B, 123 A, and 123 B, 30µl of PK Digestion buffer and 15µl of Proteinase K were added
- All samples were vortexed and spun down on the table-top mini centrifuge  
_All samples were tough to get all the eggs/bundles to the bottom of the tube submerged in the liquid. They float and stick to the walls of the tube_
- Samples were put in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C shaking at 1200 at 10:15am

Mo'orea Samples:  
- For samples 1 and 11, they were already liquid when taken out of the -20
- Most of the liquid was aspirated off (~250µl) and placed into a new tube. The remaining tissue was returned to the -20
- For samples 2 and 12, they were thawed and beads were poured into the tubes. They were homogenized by vortexing for ~30 seconds
- About ~250µl of liquid was able to be taken from the tubes and was transferred to new tubes

**DNA Extraction**

1. Eggs and bundles samples were taken out of the thermomixer at 12:45pm. There was some undigested tissue that would not digest, mostly in samples 111 and 120. All tubes were spun down and the supernatant transferred to new tubes. 111 and 120 were transferred to 5mL tubes
2. Equal volumes of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer were added to every sample tube:  

|Sample #|Volume added|
|-----|-------|
|111|600µl|
|112 A|300µl|
|112 B|300µl|
|120|600µl|
|123 A|300µl|
|123 B|300µl|
|1|250µl|
|2|250µl|
|11|250µl|
|12|250µl|

3. Mix samples by flicking and spinning down
4. 600µl of sample was gently added to Yellow DNA spin columns
5. Centrifuged columns at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
6. Flow-through was transferred to new 1.5 or 5mL tubes labeled for RNA
7. Samples 111 and 120 had an additional 600µl of sample that was spun through the column and the flow-through saved  
_note: samples 111 and 120 had white flakes/blobs that went through the DNA column and stuck to the sides of the collection tube, even though I tried to not aspirate any un-digested tissue after lysis. Samples 1 and 2 needed new collection tubes after their initial spin because a pellet (symbionts?) formed at the bottom of the collection tube_

- Followed RNA TapeStation [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- Did not run sample 1 because there was no RNA
