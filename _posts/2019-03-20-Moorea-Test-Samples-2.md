---

### DNA amounts for Pocillopora and Porites Mo'orea samples were really low in the [previous extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Eggs-Bundles-Moorea/), and RNA quality for Porites was poor. We wanted to try bead homogenizing and incubating to see if un-digested proteins/sugars were inhibiting nucleic acid binding on the columns.

#### Using the Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction [Kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

**Sample Prep**

The starting volume in the tubes (tissue stored in ~300µl DNA/RNA Shield in -20) was a limitation last time when bead homogenizing because it is impossible to get all the liquid out of the tube once the beads are in there. I tried adding 300µl DNA/RNA Shield for 2 of the samples before bead homogenizing to see if this would work better.

| Sample # | Site # | Date Collected | Type | Extraction method |
|-----|-------|------|---|---|
| 45 | 2 | 2018/03/12 | _Pocillopora verrucosa_ | bead homogenize |
| 62 | 2 | 2018/03/12 | _Pocillopora verrucosa_ | add 300µl then bead homogenize |
| 44 | 2 | 2018/03/12 | Massive _Porites_ | bead homogenize |
| 63 | 2 | 2018/03/12 | Massive _Porites_ | add 300µl then bead homogenize |

- 300µl of DNA/RNA Shield was added to samples 62 and 63
- Beads from [bead tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/zr-bashing-bead-lysis-tubes/nc1099697#?keyword=zymo+bead) were poured into the sample tubes
- All samples were homogenized by vortexing for ~30 seconds
- As much liquid was removed from the tubes as possible and transferred to new 1.5mL tubes  
_Samples 44 and 63 had mucus mountains making it hard to aspirate the liquid, these are the Porites samples_
- Appropriate volumes of PK Digestion Buffer and Proteinase K were added based on volumes

| Sample # | Tube Volume | PK Dig Buffer Vol | ProK Vol |
|---|---|---|---|
| 45 | 300µl | 30µl | 15µl |
| 62 | 500µl | 60µl | 30µl |
| 44 | 300µl | 30µl | 15µl |
| 63 | 550µl | 60µl | 30µl |

- Samples were vortexed, spun down, and placed in the Thermomixer at 55 degrees C for 5 hours (max time recommended in the kit) shaking at 1000rpm

**DNA Extraction** following [this](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Montipora-Larvae-DNA-RNA-Test/) mostly

1. 10mM Tris HCl and Nuclease-free H20 were put in the incubator at 70 degrees C
