# Another 20 DNA only extractions from _Porites_ and _Pocillopora_ Corals from Mo'orea

#### Using the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus [kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

- New [Beads](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/disruption-beads-0-5mm-yeast-1/50212143?searchHijack=true&searchTerm=50212143&searchType=RAPID&matchedCatNo=50212143) were poured into sample tubes. The new beads should be easier to pipette the liquid out of them as the do not get sucked up by the p20
- Samples were homogenized by vortexing for ~60 seconds for all samples
- Most of the liquid from the tubes was removed by pipetting. I guessed that this was about 420µl. The tubes contained a small amount of liquid and un-homogenized tissue left, so 200µl of DNA/RNA shield was added to each tube and those were put back into the -20
- Following recommendations for samples in DNA/RNA Shield from the kit protocol, 210µl of Solid Tissue Buffer and 14µl of Proteinase K were added to each sample
- Samples were votexed, spun down, and incubated at 55 degrees C for 5 hours shaking at 600rpm


**Following DNA extraction went along exactly as [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/18-Moorea-Coral-Extractions/)**

6µl of sample were aliquoted out for Qubit and Gel the next day to avoid thawing the stock.

**Qubit**

- Broad Range dsDNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- The Qubit was performed by Marygrace Trusdell
- All samples were read twice

67 and 220 were re-dos, so there might not have been that much left in the first place. I need to do a gel to see how the quality is.

**Gel Verification**

- A 1.5% agarose gel was ran to check the integrity of the genomic DNA
- Following the PPP Lab [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/)
- Samples 67 and 220 were not run on the gel
